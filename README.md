# VARSITY-d3

This repo is a temp holder of different modules that will later on be imported into the main Vue app.
Please make sure that the quality of your code is not just mediocre, and also do not use jquery; just d3.js v4.
If you need to use anther dependency, please ask first.

Finally, do not push to master, or someone else's branch.
Create/push to a branch with your name/github ID so that I can keep track and merge easier please.
